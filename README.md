# MatchsticksGames_ARM
This project is a matchsticks (Nim-style) game written entirely in ARM assembly language using the ARMLite simulator.
It was developed as part of a university assignment focused on low-level programming, branching, loops, and register manipulation.

🎮 Game Description

The game begins with a fixed number of matchsticks.
Players take turns removing 1, 2, or 3 matchsticks.
The goal is to avoid being the player who takes the last matchstick.

This program includes:

Input validation (must enter 1–3)

Looping game structure

Register-based arithmetic

Win/lose condition checking

Clear branching logic for game flow

🛠 Technologies Used

ARM Assembly (ARMLite syntax)

ARMLite Simulator / ALGUI

CPU registers (R0–R12)

Branching and looping instructions (CMP, B, BEQ, BNE, etc.)

🚀 How to Run

Open the ARMLite simulator.

Load the .asm file into the editor.

Assemble the program.

Run and follow the on-screen prompts.
