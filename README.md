# MatchsticksGames_ARM
This project is a matchsticks game written entirely in ARM assembly language using the ARMLite simulator.
It was developed as part of a university assignment focused on low-level programming, branching, loops, and register manipulation.

🎮 Game Description

The game begins by allowing a user to input the number of matchsticks from a range between 10-100
The user is able to then choose how many matchsticks to remove ranging from 1-7
The computer will then choose a random number ranging from 1-7 as well and this will continue until only 1 matchstick remains and a winner is determined
